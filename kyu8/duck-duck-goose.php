duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 1); // => $a["name"]
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 5); // => $a["name"]
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 4); // => $d["name"]

function duck_duck_goose($players, $goose) {
    $p = $players ; $g = $goose ; $z = $g - 1;$c = count($players);
    if ($g > $c){
    do { $g-= $c; }
    while ($g > $c);}
    return join('',$p[$g-1]);
